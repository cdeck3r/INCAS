# Images from Networked Camera System (INCAS) 

This project collects and stores images from multiple ONVIF compatible IP cameras. 
These images serve as input to the Social Reporter - an AI based image selection and composition system for 
generating social media content about lectures at the [HHZ](https://www.hhz.de/master/digital-business-engineering/).
